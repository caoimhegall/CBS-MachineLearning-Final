### Montgomery County Crash Reporting Data  
For our project, we explored crash data from Montgomery County, Maryland. This dataset reports details about crashes occuring on county and local roadways as collected by the Montgomery County Police via the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS). These collision reports are based on preliminary information provided to the Maryland State Police Department by reporting parties. Therefore the raw reporting data may reflect:

- Information not yet verified by further investigation
- Preliminary collision classifications may be changed at a later date based upon further investigation
- Information may include mechanical or human error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Data
Download the raw data [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data). Or see the `Crash_Reporting_-_Drivers_data.csv` raw file used in the /data folder.

#### Notebooks
`ML Final Discovery.ipynb` - Where we did all the data cleaning and EDA. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Running this file will create a cleaned dataframe `processed_data.csv` that we use for modeling.
